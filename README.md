Extract and open the zipped folder.
Move the contents into the root folder of the game, where the executable (exe) is located.
On first startup, it may take a while, wait for BepInEx to create the necessary dependency structure and start the game.
If you have one or more custom languages, you can select them from the options. The mod will remember your preference at next reboot by loading it already in your preferred language.

Installation (I already have BepInEx)

Extract and open the zipped folder.
Go to the BepInEx/plugin folder, inside is the mod folder which you will need to move to the BepInEx/plugin folder where the game is located.
If you have already started the game with BepInEx, it will load much faster.
